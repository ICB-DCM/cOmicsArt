    "content": "1. What is ComicsART? ComicsART is a tool designed to facilitate easy explorative and statistical analysis. It stands for customizable Omics Analysis and Reporting Tool. Its special focus is to guarantee reproducibility within the GUI providing you an autogenerated HTML report of which clicks have been done and to guarantee reprodubility without the GUI provding on click all code and data to fully reproduce in R what you have done within the GUI - allowing then for to enjoy the freedom and options programming gives you! 2. How do I get started with ComicsART? There are several ways- depending on what type of learner you are! You might want to first read our publication that includes the whole picture and our vision. If you want to experience the app without the own data you can use the test-dataset by simply selecting Testdata tab in the sidebar and then starting your journey. We have also screen recordings available on YouTube as well as this extensive documentation you already found! In case you are left with question feel free to mail us: cOmicsArtist@outlook.de. 3. My Data upload does not work - what do I do? ComicsART is designed to work with .csv files. If you are experiencing issues with the data upload, please ensure that your file is in the correct format. cOmicsART also provides a test dataset that you can use to familiarize yourself with the data-format the tool is expecting (Click within the Data Selection Main tab on 'Download example data'). Moreover, you can upload your data and click \"Inspect Data\" **before** clicking 'Upload new data'. Here, we try everything to still upload your data and run through our tests. At the bottom you can see which test fails and hinting you what you might have done wrong. Common issues are: Not exactly the same row or columnnames, missing values, wrong delimiters (watch out if you use german excel with ',' being the decimal sign), invalid names involving commas, whitespaces and 'Umlaute' (√§,√∂,√º). If you are still experiencing issues, please contact our support team for assistance. 4. The app is running since ages and nothing happens Is grey overlay visibile? If yes, tha app backend has crashed - this can have multiple reasons. It could be a disconnection between your browser and the server or the server itself is not running anymore. If you refresh the page you might be able to reconnect but potentially have to redo your work. We try to almost alsways give you the option to still recieve the HTML report so you know at least what has been done up to this point. If this happens often to you it might be a good idea to employ our DOCKER image or install the app locally on your machine. Instructions can be found in the 'Installation' tab in the sidebar. ",

The cOmicsART user interface evolves gradually to guide users through the necessary steps: . | Data Input Tab: The initial tab where users upload their data. A successful data upload is necessary before accessing the next tab. | Pre-Processing Tab: This tab becomes accessible after a successful data upload. It offers multiple options to prepare the data for analysis, including diagnostic plots to check for normal distribution. | Analysis Tabs: Six analysis options are available, each in its own tab. These tabs provide interactive result visualizations and various analytical functions. | . To get more information on the tabs, navigate to the respective documentation using the left sidebar. Navigation Principles . | Button Clicks: Used to evoke actions. | Loading Bars: Display waiting times during processing. | Question Marks: Provide quick help and guide to respective detailed documentation found on this very site | Dropdown Menus: Offer options for selection. Sometime multiple items can be selected. If clicking on a selected item it is removed from the selection | Checkboxes: If a checkbox is clicked, the respective feature is activated. If clicked again, the feature is deactivated. | Sliding Bars: Used to adjust numeric parameters or ranges. The range of the sliding bar is displayed above the bar. Simply slide the bar to the desired value. | Text Fields: Used to enter text. Within cOmicsART these fields are mostly used to hold your Notes, which are saved in the HTML report at approporiate position. You can use markdown syntax here. | . Features Across Tabs . | Side Panel Structure: Each tab, except the input tab, has a side panel divided by a horizontal line: . | Upper Section: Contains options affecting the analysis, requiring recomputation when changed. The analysis is triggered by a \"Do/Get analysis\" button above the division line. | Lower Section: Displays secondary parameters with changes reflecting immediately in the results (automatic update). | . | Download Options: Users can download autogenerated, HTML reports as well as visualizations and results in common formats (e.g., PNG, XLSX).
