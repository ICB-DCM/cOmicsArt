To add to Documentation you can edit the individual markdown files
in normal markdown manner

If you add a new file:
Ensure to add a header -
for a parent:
```
---
layout: default
title: "Local Installation"
nav_order: 10
---
```

for a child:
```
---
layout: default
title: "Local Installation"
parent: ???
nav_order: 10
---
```

For structure reason please ensure that children pages get placed in a folder
which name is **exactly** the same name as the parent page.
