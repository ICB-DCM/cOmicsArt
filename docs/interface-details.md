# Interface Details

If you need tab-specific information, navigate to the respective documentation using the left sidebar.

## General Design Characteristics

### User Interface and Analysis Features

The cOmicsART user interface evolves gradually to guide users through the necessary steps:

- **Data Input Tab**: The initial tab where users upload their data. A successful data upload is necessary before accessing the next tab.
- **Pre-Processing Tab**: This tab becomes accessible after a successful data upload. It offers multiple options to prepare the data for analysis, including diagnostic plots to check for normal distribution.
- **Analysis Tabs**: Six analysis options are available, each in its own tab. These tabs provide interactive result visualizations and various analytical functions.

To get more information on the tabs, navigate to the respective documentation using the left sidebar.


### Navigation Principles

- **Button Clicks**: Used to evoke actions.
- **Loading Bars**: Display waiting times during processing.
- **Question Marks**: Provide quick help and guide to respective detailed documentation found on this very site
- **Dropdown Menus**: Offer options for selection. Sometime multiple items can be selected. If clicking on a selected item it is removed from the selection
- **Checkboxes**: If a checkbox is clicked, the respective feature is activated. If clicked again, the feature is deactivated.
- **Sliding Bars**: Used to adjust numeric parameters or ranges. The range of the sliding bar is displayed above the bar. Simply slide the bar to the desired value.
- **Text Fields**: Used to enter text. Within cOmicsART these fields are mostly used to hold your Notes, which are saved in the HTML report at approporiate position. You can use [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) here.
