cOmicsArt allows you to reproduce your analysis not only **within** the application 
through the report, but also independently of the application using provided R code. 
This not only guarantees the reproducibility of your analysis, but also allows you to 
easily adjust your analysis to your needs.

This page provides information regarding the Code and Data download for 
cOmicsART. We explain the [general code structure](code-and-data/r-code.md) and provide an [example how to adjust the code](code-and-data/examples.md). Note that the adjusted code is only exemplary 
and not exhaustive. We encourage you to explore the code and adjust it to your needs.
