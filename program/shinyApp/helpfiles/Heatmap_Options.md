1. **Batch Correction**: Use batch-corrected data if available (set in Pre-processing).

2. **Select Entities**: Choose which entities to display:
   - All: Shows all entities.
   - Based on Annotation: Filter rows using provided annotations.
   - Top K: Display top entities based on criteria (e.g., LogFoldChange, significance).
   Set criteria, number of entities (K), reference, treatment group, and p-value threshold.
   
**Conditional Options**: conditional option and helper questions will show up for the selected option.
   - Annotation-based Selection: Filter rows by variables in row annotations.
   - Top K Selection: Order entities by LogFoldChange or significance and specify 
     thresholds.

**Note:**
- Optimize row selection options to focus on specific subsets of data, such as significant changes or custom annotation-based criteria.
- Experiment with different row selection methods to highlight patterns and features relevant to your analysis.
