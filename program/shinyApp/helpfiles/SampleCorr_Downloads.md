These buttons serve for various downloading purposes.

***
**Send only to Report**

With this button, you send the current plot to the HTML-report (can be downloaded 
right below the logo). It also saves the relevant parameters you chose to reproduce 
the plot.

***
**</> Get underlying R code and data**

Here we generate the relevant R code for you to reproduce the plot starting from data 
selection up to the `ggplot` commands. Relevant data is downloaded together with the 
code in a zip-folder to enable running the code locally. This is a nice choice if 
you either **want to learn coding** and understand what was done, or if you want to 
**individualize your plot** beyond the standard options we provide.

***
**Save Plot**

Save the current plot in the file format *specified below*.
