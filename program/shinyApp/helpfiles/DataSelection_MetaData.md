### ShinyApp/helpfiles/DataSelection_MetaData.md - Under Development

***

Here you can upload you `Meta Data Sheet` to easily upload all data at once in 
addition to a very detailed metadata information on the samples. This not only eases 
the upload but also allows you to investigate the data in much more detail.

For a guide on the metadata sheet, please refer to the paper by [Seep et al.](TBA).
