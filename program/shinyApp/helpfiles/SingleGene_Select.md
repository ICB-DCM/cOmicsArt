## Choosing groups for comparison

---
This options lets you specify how group the samples based on the annotation categories 
provided in the sample annotation file. This only has an effect if you have chosen 
`boxplots_withTesting` as the visualization style.

The groupings can then be used to run statistical tests on the data. The data you want 
to run the tests on can then be specified under `Select your desired comparisons`.
