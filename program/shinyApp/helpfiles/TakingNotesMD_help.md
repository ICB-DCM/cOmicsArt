## Personal Note Taking
This Section is here for your Notes. It can be as easy as just a keyword or as complex as an entire figure description or even an entire book (however I do think there are better tools for this).
To enable possibilities to structure your text, involving headings, bullets points or colored chunks `markdown` syntax can be used. 
>Click [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for their detailed documentation.

To get you quickly started here is a snippet that uses headings, bullet points and some bold text:

```
#### Remarks:
- Plot looks fine
- sample xxxx potentially candidate for an outlier **Needs Further check**

#### What came to my mind not directly related to the plot:
##### Literature I still need to read
[Seep et al](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87643-8)

##### Further procedure
1. Check next plot
2. combine plots
3. Have a coffee

```
The above shown will output in the Report the following:
