### ShinyApp/helpfiles/DataSelection_RowSelection.md - Under Development

***

With `Row selection` you can choose the entities (e.g. genes) you want to include in the 
analysis.

With the first slider you can choose a category (e.g. gene names or gene types), by 
which you want to filter the entities. The second slider allows you to choose the data 
to include in the analysis concretly. The categories and data available depend on the 
entitie annotation you have chosen in the `Data upload` section.

`Sample selection` allows you to choose the samples you want to include in the 
analysis in a similar fashion.
