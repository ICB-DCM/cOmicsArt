#### What are those checks?
Within the Visual Inspection, cOmicsArt checks the uploaded data for multiple criteria. The required tests must be all display a **Yes** while the optional tests can be **No**.
Common sources of mistakes during data-upload:
- mixing the three table with each other - ensure that the data matrix is the first file, the sample information is the second file and the entity information is the third file
- export from excel to csv does not work properly - the actual e.g. sample names are in the first column rather in the rownames 
- typos within the respective names - e.g. a sample name is written in two different ways (SRr is something different than SRR)
