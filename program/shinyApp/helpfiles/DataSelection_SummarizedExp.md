### ShinyApp/helpfiles/DataSelection_SummarizedExp.md - Under Development

***

With this option, you can upload previously used data. This allows you to upload 
everything at once. Additionally, you can upload results from previous analyses. It is 
also theoretically possible to upload a SummarizedExperiment object from R, that was 
created with a different tool. In this case, we would advice to use the preprocessing 
option `None`.

To generate an uploadable object, just use the `Save file input to upload later` button.
