### helpfiles/SummarizedExp_help.md - Under Development

The file that is created after uploading your files and downloading a pre-complied data set.
In fact this is an R object called ```SummarizedExperiment```. You can read more about [here](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/SummarizedExperiment/inst/doc/SummarizedExperiment.html).
Specifically Bioconductor - packages are relying on this storage type. Therefore you can use this object created here also for other packages and analysis that might not be covered here! (Or at least as a starting point).
If you found an analysis that you want to conduct which relies on the ```SummarizedExperiment```-object have a good look at the supplied Vignettes. If you still need help feel free to contact your favorite Bioinformatician.
